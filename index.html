  <p>A chemical reaction is any thermodynamic process in which two or more chemical species or substances (called reactants or reagents) are transformed, changing their molecular structure and their bonds, into other substances called products. The reactants can be elements or compounds. An example of a chemical reaction is the formation of iron oxide produced when oxygen in the air reacts with iron naturally, or a magnesium ribbon when placed in a flame becomes magnesium oxide, as an example of an induced reaction.</p>
  <p>The chemical reaction can also be defined from two approaches, the macroscopic one that defines it as <i>«a process in which one or several substances are formed from another or others»</i> and the nanoscopic one whose definition would be: <i>«redistribution of atoms and ions, forming other structures (molecules or networks)»</i></p>
  <p>Chemical reactions occur because molecules are moving and when they hit each other with enough energy, the bonds are broken and atoms are exchanged to form new molecules. Also a molecule that is vibrating with sufficient energy can break into smaller molecules.</p>

  <header>Chemical phenomenon</header>
  <p>A chemical phenomenon is called the observable and measurable events in which the substances involved change their chemical composition when they combine with each other.5 Chemical reactions involve an interaction that occurs at the level of the valence electrons of the substances involved. This interaction is the chemical bond.</p>
  <p>In these phenomena, the original substance is not preserved, its chemical structure is transformed, it manifests energy, it is not observed with the naked eye and they are mostly irreversible</p>
  <p>The substance undergoes irreversible changes. For example, when burned, a paper cannot return to its original state. The resulting ashes were part of the original paper, and underwent chemical alteration.</p>

  <header>Factors affecting reaction rate</header>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Nature of the reaction:</b> Some reactions are, by their very nature, faster than others. The number of reacting species, their physical state; Particles that form solids move more slowly than those of gases or those in solution. The complexity of the reaction, and other factors can greatly influence the rate of a reaction. For example, the reaction of alkali metals with substances such as oxygen or water is immediate as the first mentioned are quite reactive.</li>
    <li><b>Concentration:</b> The rate of reaction increases with concentration, as described by the rate law and explained by collision theory. As the concentration of the reactants increases, the collision frequency also increases.</li>
    <li><b>Pressure:</b> The rate of gas reactions increases very significantly with pressure, which is, in effect, equivalent to increasing the concentration of the gas. For condensed phase reactions, the pressure dependence is weak, and only becomes important when the pressure is very high.</li>
    <li><b>Order:</b> The order of the reaction controls how concentration (or pressure) affects the reaction rate.</li>
    <li><b>Temperature:</b> Generally, carrying out a reaction at a higher temperature provides more energy to the system, which increases the reaction rate by causing more collisions between particles, as explained by collision theory. However, the main reason why an increase in temperature increases the reaction rate is that there are a greater number of colliding particles that have the necessary activation energy for the reaction to occur, resulting in more successful collisions.</li>

  <header>Chemical performance</header>
  <p>The amount of product that is usually obtained from a chemical reaction is less than the theoretical amount. This depends on several factors, such as the purity of the reagent and the secondary reactions that may take place (not all products may react), it is worth mentioning that 100% recovery of the sample is practically impossible.The yield of a reaction is calculated using the following formula:</p>
  <code>
    performance(%) = actual quantity of product/ideal amount of product * 100
  </code>
  <p>Cuando uno de los reactivos esté en exceso, el rendimiento deberá calcularse respecto al reactivo limitante. Y el rendimiento depende del calor que expone la reacción.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Degree_of_progress_of_the_reaction_and_affinity">
  <header>Degree of progress of the reaction and affinity</header>
  <p>A reaction can be represented by the following mathematical expression:<br><br><code>∑_(i=1)^N▒〖Vi[Ci]=0〗</code><br><br>where 
<code>νi</code> are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reaction, which can be positive (products) or negative (reactants). The equation presents two possible ways of being chemically in nature (as a sum of products or as a sum of reactants)</p>
<p>When there is an equilibrium in the reaction, the Gibbs free energy is a minimum, so:<br><br><code>δG= ∑_k▒〖μkvkdE=〗</code><code>=-AdE=0,</code><br><br>allows us to understand that the chemical affinity is zero.</p>
